# NOTES

## Makefile

The provided makefile targets were implemented for setup, server, and test.  Dependencies
should be correct so you can `git clone...` the repo, then, `make test` for the entire
suite.  This will leave the app running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Manually

If you want to install, run, or test manually, you can refer to the following instruction
files.

Installing the code/app: -> INSTALLATION.md
Testing: -> TESTING.md
Running: docker-compose, docker, or npm -> RUNNING.md


## OTHER NOTES

I've provided a set of points I wanted to make in `docs/NOTES-FOR-EVALUATOR.md`.
