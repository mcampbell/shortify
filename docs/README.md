# `docs`

In this directory are the documentation files for the project, not limited to:

- original Makefile + PRD
- `Journal.md` - ongoing development journal; used for "daily standups" and notes to myself
- `Resources.md` - a list of external resources I used to complete the project
- `TODO.md` - stuff I don't want to forget to do before submission
